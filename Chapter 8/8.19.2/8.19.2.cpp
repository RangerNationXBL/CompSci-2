There is no need to use getline. Instead, use one while loop to process all of the lines in the file. 
Inside that loop, use two smaller loops: the first to read the name, and the second to add up the scores 
for that student. To read the name, use get to read until you encounter a digit, adding each character to 
the studentâ€™s name. To add the scores, write a second loop that processes the rest of the line. Use the 
one-character look-ahead technique from the section "Reading Text Input" to read and sum the numbers.

Print the name and total score for each student.
