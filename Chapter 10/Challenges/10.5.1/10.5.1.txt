A ForgetfulCritter can't remember its history. Everytime it tries to, only a "?" is recorded. 
Implement a derived class from Critter whose add_history function behaves as described. Note 
that Critter::add_history has been declared virtual so that Critter::move will call the correct 
version of add_history when the critter is a ForgetfulCritter.
