Given two GVDie objects that represent 2 six-sided dice and an integer that represents a desired value as parameters, 
complete the function RollingForPair() in the main class. The main class rolls the dice until a pair with the desired 
value is rolled. The function RollingForPair() then returns the number of rolls thrown to achieve the result. Assume 
the desired value received from input is within the appropriate range, 1-6.

Note: For testing purposes, the GVDie objects are created in the main() function using a pseudo-random number generator 
with a fixed seed value. The program uses a seed value of 15 during development, but when submitted, a different seed 
value will be used for each test case.

Ex: If the GVDie objects are created with a seed value of 15 and the input of the program is:
    2
the output is:
    It took 82 rolls to get a pair of 2's.
